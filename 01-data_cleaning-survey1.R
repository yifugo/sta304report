#### Workspace setup ####
library(haven)
library(tidyverse)

# Read in the raw data (You might need to change this if you use a different dataset)
raw_data <- read_dta("inputs/ns20200625.dta")

# Add the labels
raw_data <- labelled::to_factor(raw_data)

#raw_data %>% head() %>% View()

# Just keep some variables

#### What else???? ####
# Maybe make some age-groups?
# Maybe check the values?
# Is vote a binary? If not, what are you going to do?
